survey_type: Vital Rate Measuremnts from photomosaic imagery
survey_description: 'Photoquadrat imagery is collected at sites (1m above the benthos, every 1m along a 30m transect) and annotated using CoralNet.  Surveys are conducted at select sites following a stratified-random sampling site design (StRS). Random sites are generated along a depth gradient using the R project <a href = "https://github.com/krtanaka/ncrmp_common_map" target = "_blank">ncrmp_common_map</a>.  Images are analyzed to produce three functional group levels of benthic cover. Refer to InPort metadata records or SOP for more details.'
